# About

The Singapore Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Challenge (SAUVC) is an annual international competition that aims to promote the development of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and encourage the exploration of innovative technologies in the field. The competition is open to undergraduate and graduate students from around the world, and provides a platform for teams to showcase their skills and contribute to the advancement of AUV technology.

Participating teams are required to design and build an AUV that can successfully complete a series of tasks, including object identification and retrieval, navigation through an obstacle course, and acoustic localization. The tasks are designed to test the capabilities and efficiency of the AUVs, as well as the team's understanding of the underlying technologies and principles.

One of the main tasks of the SAUVC is object identification and retrieval. Teams are required to locate and retrieve a predetermined object from the competition area using their AUV. The AUV must be able to locate the object using its sensors and then retrieve it using a manipulator arm or other mechanism. This task requires the AUV to have precise navigation capabilities and the ability to identify and distinguish objects based on their characteristics. The object identification and retrieval task is particularly important as it simulates real-world scenarios in which AUVs may be used for search and rescue operations or to retrieve objects from the ocean floor.

Another task of the SAUVC is navigation through an obstacle course. Teams are required to program their AUV to navigate through a series of gates and markers placed in the competition area. The AUV must be able to avoid obstacles and accurately follow the predetermined course. This task requires the AUV to have robust and reliable navigation capabilities, as well as the ability to adjust its course in real-time to avoid obstacles. The obstacle course task is designed to test the AUV's ability to navigate complex environments and to adapt to changing conditions.

Overall, the SAUVC is a valuable opportunity for teams to showcase their skills and contribute to the advancement of AUV technology. The competition provides a platform for students to gain practical experience in the design and development of AUVs, and to engage with experts in the field. The SAUVC is an important event for the AUV community, and continues to be a driving force in the development and promotion of this exciting and innovative technology.
