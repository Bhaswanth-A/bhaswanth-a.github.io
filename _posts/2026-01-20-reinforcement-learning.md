# Deep Learning

This series of blogs are my notes from the class [10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S25/index.html), taught by [Katerina Fragkiadaki](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~katef/) and [Aviral Kumar](https://aviralkumar2907.github.io/) at CMU, as well as learnings from the book “Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto”. For my own sake of understanding and simplicity, the blog has been divided into 2 categories:
1. [Introduction to Reinforcement Learning](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/intro-to-rl/)
2. [Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/deep-rl/)
3. [Advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning]()
