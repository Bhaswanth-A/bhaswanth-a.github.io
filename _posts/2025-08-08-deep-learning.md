# Deep Learning

This series of blogs are my notes from the class [11-785 Introduction to Deep Learning](https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/S25/index.html), taught by [Bhiksha Raj](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/ramakrishnan-bhiksha-raj.html) at CMU. For my own sake of understanding and simplicity, the blog has been divided into 4 broad categories:
1. [Perceptrons](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/deep-learning-perceptrons/)
2. [CNNs, RNNs, and Language Models](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/deep-learning-cnn-rnn-lang/)
3. [Attention and Transformers](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/deep-learning-advanced/) - Talks about why attention is all we need
4. Generative Modeling
