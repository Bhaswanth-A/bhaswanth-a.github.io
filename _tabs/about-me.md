Hey there! I am Bhaswanth Ayapilla, a passionate fourth-year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Hyderabad. My major is Electronics and Communication Engineering, with a minor in Robotics and Automation. 

I have a deep-rooted passion for robotics, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, which has shaped my academic journey and career aspirations.

I am currently doing my thesis at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics, Lisboa](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) under the supervision of [Dr. David Cabecinhas](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/davidalexandre/) and [Dr. Pedro Batista](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/pedrotiagomartins/) in underwater robotics. 

In addition, I am working as a summer intern at [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Laboratory, National University of Singapore](https://www.marmotlab.org/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html) on multi-agent traffic signal control using reinforcement learning. 

If you are looking to collaborate or would like to have a chat, please reach out to me via [email](mailto:bhaswanthayapilla@gmail.com).
