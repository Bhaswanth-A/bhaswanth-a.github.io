<!-- Hey there! I am Bhaswanth Ayapilla, a passionate fourth-year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Hyderabad. I am pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering, with a minor in Robotics and Automation. -->

Hey there! I am Bhaswanth Ayapilla, and I am an incoming student at the Masters in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am in my final year pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at BITS Pilani Hyderabad, with a focused minor in Robotics and Automation.

<!-- I have a deep-rooted passion for robotics, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, which has shaped my academic journey and career aspirations. -->

My academic journey has been fueled by an unwavering passion for robotics, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, serving as the cornerstone of my educational endeavors and professional aspirations.

During my undergraduate tenure, I completed my thesis at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics, Lisbon](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) under the supervision of [Dr. David Cabecinhas](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/davidalexandre/) and [Dr. Pedro Batista](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/pedrotiagomartins/) in underwater robotics. Check out my work here: [Autonomous Underwater Glider Simulator](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/aug-simulator/). 

Additionally, I worked as a summer intern at the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Laboratory, National University of Singapore](https://www.marmotlab.org/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html) on multi-agent traffic signal control using reinforcement learning.
