<span style="font-size:1.5em;">Hey there! I am Bhaswanth Ayapilla.</span>


<!-- Hey there! I am Bhaswanth Ayapilla, a passionate fourth-year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani Hyderabad. I am pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering, with a minor in Robotics and Automation. -->

I am currently pursuing my Master's in Robotic Systems Development (MRSD) program at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently interning as a Robotics Engineer at Milwaukee Tool. As part of my Master's program, I am working on my capstone project in space robotics — developing the Lunar ROADSTER, a Robotic Operator for Autonomous Development of Surface Trails and Exploration Routes on the Moon. This exciting project is under the supervision of [Dr. William "Red" Whittaker](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/william-red-l-whittaker/). You can learn more about the project here: [Lunar ROADSTER](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/lunar-roadster-cmu/).

My heart lies in field robotics — to develop robots that can operate and navigate in unpredictable, unstructured environments, especially for applications in space exploration and automation on Earth. I love working across the entire spectrum of robotics, from design and hardware integration to software development.

I am a recent graduate from BITS Pilani, India, where I majored in Electronics and Communication Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Automation. During my undergraduate tenure, I completed my thesis at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics, Lisbon](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) under the supervision of [Dr. David Cabecinhas](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/davidalexandre/) and [Dr. Pedro Batista](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/pedrotiagomartins/) in underwater robotics. Check out my work here: [Autonomous Underwater Glider Simulator](https://bhaswanth-a.github.io/posts/aug-simulator/).

<!-- I have a deep-rooted passion for robotics, reinforcement learning, and deep learning, which has shaped my academic journey and career aspirations. -->

<!-- Additionally, I worked as a summer intern at the [Multi-Agent Robotic Motion Laboratory, National University of Singapore](https://www.marmotlab.org/index.html) under the supervision of [Dr. Guillaume Sartoretti](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html) on multi-agent traffic signal control using reinforcement learning.  -->
